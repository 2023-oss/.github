# :lock: DID-based facility use agreement generation and verification system
There is a risk of personal information leakage when writing a consent form for facility use or consent form for personal information in an offline environment. 
<br/>
The consent form for the use of facilities written in paper is inconvenient for business operators to manage, and it is cumbersome for users to fill out and submit it in paper.

**Our custom sign service** utilizes its own open-source public blockchain "Plate Chain" and it is a 'DID' based personal information submission system that utilizes 'SSI(Self-Signature Identifier)' which is managed by users with sovereignty over personal information.

There are many Blockchain DID services currently in service, but if DID previously dealt with historical evidence and document reliability, our open source provides additional advantages by devising more automatic document destruction systems for privacy.

In addition, it is an open source project using a public blockchain network developed directly without relying on other public blockchains (ex. Ethereum, Bitcoin), etc., so it can be applied lightly when there is a new idea or technology to be applied to DID.

### What's DID?
Decentralized Identification (DID) is a next-generation authentication method that grants individuals the sovereignty of data and enables successful authentication without going through a centralized third party. Not a particular agency has identity information, but identity is distributed across all blocks in the blockchain.<br/>
Through DID, personal information is owned by individuals and minimal information can be used when necessary, so identity sovereignty can be restored.

1.The user (Holder) and the issuer (Issuer) each generate a public key pair and send it to the blockchain network.

2.The Holder receives a signed user qualification (VC) from a validated issuer.

3. Qualifications issued by trusted organizations
